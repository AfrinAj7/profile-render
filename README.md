Hey ! Terribly Tiny Tales visit the site for results : https://profile-render.vercel.app/ 
This Project is created for Rendering a Profile screen. But i haven't created the Exactly Image as you proivided just because of lack of time and My Semester Exam have started but i have created just a simple profile page Where the name and the users designation is shown.
Create a new React app:
npx create-react-app profile-screen
cd profile-screen
To render the profile data from a JSON file, 
you can modify the React component to fetch and use the data from the JSON file. Here's how you can do it:
Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your profile screen. 
Open the browser's developer tools (Chrome Inspect) and toggle the device toolbar to check the mobile view.
 It uses the useState and useEffect hooks to fetch the data when the component mounts. 
 The fetched data is then stored in the profileData state, and the component renders based on this data.
adjust the path in the fetch call based on your project structure.
Now, when you run the app, it will fetch the profile data from the JSON file and render it in the profile screen.
